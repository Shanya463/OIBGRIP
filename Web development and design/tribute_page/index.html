                  <p>
                    Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman was born at Tiruchirappalli in Southern India on November 7th, 1888. He entered Presidency College, Madras, in 1902, and in 1904 passed his B.A. examination,
                    winning the first place and the gold medal in physics; in 1907 he gained his M.A. degree, obtaining the highest distinctions. His earliest researches in optics and acoustics the two fields
                    of investigation to which he has dedicated his entire career were carried out while he was a student.Since at that time a scientific career did not appear to present the best possibilities,
                    Raman joined the Indian Finance Department in 1907; though the duties of his office took most of his time, Raman found opportunities for carrying on experimental research in the laboratory 
                    of the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science at Calcutta (of which he became Honorary Secretary in 1919).

                    In 1917 he was offered the newly endowed Palit Chair of Physics at Calcutta University, and decided to accept it. After 15 years at Calcutta he became Professor at the Indian Institute of 
                    Science at Bangalore (1933-1948), and since 1948 he is Director of the Raman Institute of Research at Bangalore, established and endowed by himself. He also founded the Indian Journal of 
                    Physics in 1926, of which he is the Editor. Raman sponsored the establishment of the Indian Academy of Sciences and has served as President since its inception. He also initiated the 
                    Proceedings of that academy, in which much of his work has been published, and is President of the Current Science Association, Bangalore, which publishes Current Science (India).
                    Raman has been honoured with a large number of honorary doctorates and memberships of scientific societies. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society early in his career (1924),
                    and was knighted in 1929.
